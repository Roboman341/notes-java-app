I'm looking for a concise, high-level roadmap to build a simple web application in Java 21, using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, with a basic structure like Google Keep. The core features I want are:

User authentication so each user can create and manage their own account.
Personalized notes where each user can create, view, edit, and delete only their own notes.
Image upload functionality for each note, with secure storage.
Database support, starting with an embedded H2 database for early development and then moving to PostgreSQL.
I don't need specific code snippets or implementation details; I'm looking for broad steps and components involved in achieving this functionality so I can search for examples and deepen my knowledge.
